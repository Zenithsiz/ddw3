# Documentation

This directory contains several important documentation files for how the project works.

## Topics

- [Image files (tims)](tim.md)
- [Executables](exec.md)

> TODO: Pack files and lang files.

## General notes

All `yaml` header files use absolute paths to mean root of project. You can use a double absolute path `//<path>` to encode a truly absolute path. This however should only be done locally. The repo shouldn't require any absolute paths.

> Note for windows users: I'm not sure how exactly this works under windows, you would need to test it.
