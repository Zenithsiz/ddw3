	"You can become partners with\nVeemon, who isn't in any pack.\nTry to find out how by yourself.[pause][clear]Veemon learns ExVeemon, Stingmon\nand Paildramon, after which he\nlearns many digivolution types. For[pause][clear]example when you raise Paildramon's\nskill and build his Machine Defense\nhe learns Metalmamemon. He learns[pause][clear]Devimon if you build his Dark\nDefense.[pause]",
	"Low-level partners can safely gain\nEXP points by entering into battle at\nthe beginning, then changing out[pause][clear]soon afterwards. Levels can be\nefficiently gained by entering two\npartners into a single battle. [pause][clear]Digimons learn new digivolutions and\ntechniques when they gain levels or\ntheir skills reach a multiple of 5.[pause]",
	"Any partner is capable of acquiring all\n14 digivolution types depending on\nhow it is raised. Digivolutions of the[pause][clear]same type are listed in rows across\nthe digivolution Chart. As the\nDigimon's skill level is increased, it[pause][clear]learns new digivolutions of the same\ntype. New digivolutions can also be\nlearned by gaining levels. Some[pause][clear]digivolutions cannot be acquired without\nlearning multiple other digivolutions.[pause]",
	"Level and Skill limits are set at\n99. The Parameter limit is 999.\nEven if a Digimon reaches the Level[pause][clear]limit it can still raise its Parameters\nby using a chip. Rumor has it there\nare Train chips that increase TP,[pause][clear]but they aren't sold at shops.\nTry fishing and Kicking trees.[pause]",
	"Be sure to use Plug-in items. Even\nif you have not learned any support\ntechniques, items can help you in[pause][clear]battle. Blast digivolutions are\ndecided based on your partner and\nhis level. When the gauge builds up[pause][clear]wait for your chance to use it. \nWhen away from hotels, watch your\nMP level. If you decide to retreat, [pause][clear]don't worry about anything \nelse![pause]",
	"Even if you raise your Digimons\nunevenly, you can earn EXP points\nefficiently by finding and choosing[pause][clear]enemies weak in certain areas. Use\nMagical attacks against enemies strong\nin Physical attacks, and vice versa.[pause][clear]Some enemies are prone to certain\nattributes and attacks. Discover their\nweaknesses and create a pattern.[pause]",
	"Growlmon and other Guilmon-type\ndigivolutions learn unusual techniques\nsuch as Steal and Counter.[pause][clear]Sometimes enemies possess items not\nsold in shops. These are easy to obtain\nusing the Steal technique.[pause][clear]The strength of Counterattacks depends\non the amount of damage received. Try\nto take damage on purpose.[pause]",
