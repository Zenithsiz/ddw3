    You can become partners with
    Veemon, who isn't in any pack.
    Try to find out how by yourself.[pause][\x0203]Veemon learns ExVeemon, Stingmon
    and Paildramon, after which he
    learns many digivolution types. For[pause][\x0203]example when you raise Paildramon's
    skill and build his Machine Defense
    he learns Metalmamemon. He learns[pause][\x0203]Devimon if you build his Dark
    Defense.[pause]

    Low-level partners can safely gain
    EXP points by entering into battle at
    the beginning, then changing out[pause][\x0203]soon afterwards. Levels can be
    efficiently gained by entering two
    partners into a single battle. [pause][\x0203]Digimons learn new digivolutions and
    techniques when they gain levels or
    their skills reach a multiple of 5.[pause]
  - |-
    Any partner is capable of acquiring all
    14 digivolution types depending on
    how it is raised. Digivolutions of the[pause][\x0203]same type are listed in rows across
    the digivolution Chart. As the
    Digimon's skill level is increased, it[pause][\x0203]learns new digivolutions of the same
    type. New digivolutions can also be
    learned by gaining levels. Some[pause][\x0203]digivolutions cannot be acquired without
    learning multiple other digivolutions.[pause]
  - |-
    Level and Skill limits are set at
    99. The Parameter limit is 999.
    Even if a Digimon reaches the Level[pause][\x0203]limit it can still raise its Parameters
    by using a chip. Rumor has it there
    are Train chips that increase TP,[pause][\x0203]but they aren't sold at shops.
    Try fishing and Kicking trees.[pause]
  - "Be sure to use Plug-in items. Even\nif you have not learned any support\ntechniques, items can help you in[pause][\\x0203]battle. Blast digivolutions are\ndecided based on your partner and\nhis level. When the gauge builds up[pause][\\x0203]wait for your chance to use it. \nWhen away from hotels, watch your\nMP level. If you decide to retreat, [pause][\\x0203]don't worry about anything \nelse![pause]"
  - |-
    Even if you raise your Digimons
    unevenly, you can earn EXP points
    efficiently by finding and choosing[pause][\x0203]enemies weak in certain areas. Use
    Magical attacks against enemies strong
    in Physical attacks, and vice versa.[pause][\x0203]Some enemies are prone to certain
    attributes and attacks. Discover their
    weaknesses and create a pattern.[pause]
  - |-
    Growlmon and other Guilmon-type
    digivolutions learn unusual techniques
    such as Steal and Counter.[pause][\x0203]Sometimes enemies possess items not
    sold in shops. These are easy to obtain
    using the Steal technique.[pause][\x0203]The strength of Counterattacks depends
    on the amount of damage received. Try
    to take damage on purpose.[pause]
