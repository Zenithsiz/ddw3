        You can become partners with

        and Paildramon, after which he

        Low-level partners can safely gain
        EXP points by entering into battle at
        the beginning, then changing out[pause][\x0203]soon afterwards. Levels can be
        efficiently gained by entering two
        partners into a single battle. [pause][\x0203]Digimons learn new digivolutions and
        techniques when they gain levels or
        their skills reach a multiple of 5.[pause]

        Any partner is capable of acquiring all
        14 digivolution types depending on
        how it is raised. Digivolutions of the[pause][\x0203]same type are listed in rows across
        the digivolution Chart. As the
        Digimon's skill level is increased, it[pause][\x0203]learns new digivolutions of the same
        type. New digivolutions can also be
        learned by gaining levels. Some[pause][\x0203]digivolutions cannot be acquired without
        learning multiple other digivolutions.[pause]
      - |-
        Level and Skill limits are set at
        99. The Parameter limit is 999.
        Even if a Digimon reaches the Level[pause][\x0203]limit it can still raise its Parameters
        by using a chip. Rumor has it there
        are Train chips that increase TP,[pause][\x0203]but they aren't sold at shops.
        Try fishing and Kicking trees.[pause]
      - "Be sure to use Plug-in items. Even\nif you have not learned any support\ntechniques, items can help you in[pause][\\x0203]battle. Blast digivolutions are\ndecided based on your partner and\nhis level. When the gauge builds up[pause][\\x0203]wait for your chance to use it. \nWhen away from hotels, watch your\nMP level.

      - |-
        Even if you raise your Digimons
        unevenly, you can earn EXP points
        efficiently by finding and choosing[pause][\x0203]enemies weak in certain areas. Use
        Magical attacks against enemies strong
        in Physical attacks, and vice versa.[pause][\x0203]Some enemies are prone to certain
        attributes and attacks. Discover their
        weaknesses and create a pattern.[pause]
      - |-
        Growlmon and other Guilmon-type
        digivolutions learn unusual techniques
        such as Steal and Counter.[pause][\x0203]Sometimes enemies possess items not
        sold in shops. These are easy to obtain
        using the Steal technique.[pause][\x0203]The strength of Counterattacks depends
        on the amount of damage received. Try
        to take damage on purpose.[pause]
