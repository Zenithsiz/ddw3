    personally when I beat
    you![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Masato[\x0207]Oh yeah! I might not
    be able to beat
    Tomomi yet![pause][\x0203]She's stronger than
    I am, which is
    embarrassing...[pause][\x0203]because I'm a man![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Masato[\x0207]Oh no! I...
    I lost![pause][\x0203]This is awful!
    Tomomi's going
    to dump me![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Alexei[\x0207]When I was turned
    into an Oinkmon, I
    swore to the gods[pause][\x0203]that if I became
    human again, I'd
    quit drinking![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Alexei[\x0207]Heh heh heh. Alright
    boy, prepare to
    witness the power of[pause][\x0203]me - sober![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Alexei[\x0207]Ha ha ha! Have you
    had enough?[pause][\x0203]No one's going to call
    me Alcoholic Alexei
    anymore![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Alexei[\x0207]Arrrgh! I can't take
    it! I need just one
    little sip...[pause][\x0203]No, I can't! I
    swore I'd never
    drink again![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Tomomi[\x0207]I logged in today with
    Masato! We're
    competing to see who[pause][\x0203]can defeat the most
    tamers![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Tomomi[\x0207]So come help me
    out. A game of
    cards is fine![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Tomomi[\x0207]Yes!
    Thank you![pause][\x0203]Now I can brag
    about this to
    Masato![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Tomomi[\x0207]Oh well, I lost. To
    be honest, I don't
    really care about[pause][\x0203]this competition. I
    just wanted to play
    by myself![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Akiba[\x0207]La la-la la la--la!
    I'm the merry tamer
    Akiba![pause][\x0203]I've come back to
    Digimon Online.
    La la-la la la--la![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Akiba[\x0207]It would be
    wonderful if I
    could play a[pause][\x0203]game of cards.
    What do you
    say?[pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Akiba[\x0207]Yes I am amazing.
    I felled you, I did.
    La la-la la la--la![pause][\x0203]This is why I can
    never quit Digimon
    Online.[pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Akiba[\x0207]This is horrible!
    I... I lost!
    I think I'm in[pause][\x0203]shock. I can't
    bear to sing
    anymore today![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Gon[\x0207]Aaaah! Just when I
    hid myself, someone
    found me![pause][\x0203]Woops! Some habits
    are hard to stop![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Gon[\x0207]Indeed, that was
    quite
    embarrassing.[pause][\x0203]How about I
    make it up with
    a card game?[pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Gon[\x0207]Indeed, I won.
    I'm sorry!
    Wait a minute.[pause][\x0203]You're the one at
    fault for not
    training enough![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Gon[\x0207]Indeed, you are quite
    powerful. I'm feel so
    safe knowing there[pause][\x0203]are strong tamers like
    you around![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Wan[\x0207]I knew Digimon Online
    would be running
    again! I'm glad the[pause][\x0203]Lucky Mouse, er,
    Kurt brought it back![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Wan[\x0207]So how about a game
    of cards? I won't
    hold back![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Wan[\x0207]Pardon me for
    winning.[pause][\x0203]What happened?
    Are you feeling
    well today?[pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Wan[\x0207]Incredible! You're
    as strong as they
    say![pause][\x0203]Fighting with you
    is truly an
    education.[pause]

    It's me, Kenny!
    How've you been?[pause][\x0203]You were really
    something awhile
    back![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Kenny[\x0207]It's been too
    long. How about
    some cards?[pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Kenny[\x0207]Alright!

    me because I'm old!
    Eeeheheheheh![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Jessica[\x0207]Oh I feel bad
    beating you.
    But you don't nearly[pause][\x0203]have as much
    experience as I do
    at cards.[pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Jessica[\x0207]Heavens me, you
    really are good at
    this! I look forward[pause][\x0203]to seeing how strong
    you'll become!
    Eeeheheheheh![pause]

    A.o.A., right?[pause][\x0203]Wow! One tamer
    saved the entire
    world![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Haruko[\x0207]I've always wanted
    to battle with you.[pause][\x0203]How about
    granting this old
    lady her dream![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Haruko[\x0207]Oh my! I beat you
    now didn't I?
    Tamers nowadays[pause][\x0203]just aren't what
    they used to be.[pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Haruko[\x0207]Oh my, I lost![pause][\x0203]I guess my days as
    "Gal Gamer Haruko"
    are over.[pause]

    What is up! You've come
    far, but I'm afraid your[pause][\x0203]luck ends here! Let me
    explain it to you. You

  - |-
    [\x0207]Keith[\x0207]You got it?
    Alright then,
    let's go![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Keith[\x0207]Hahahaha!
    You see? It's like I
    was saying. I am the[pause][\x0203]Card King! You just
    don't have what it
    takes to defeat ME![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Keith[\x0207]No! This cannot be
    happening![pause][\x0203]You are inextricably
    unbelievable! Here,
    take this. It's the [pause][\x0203]KoC Trophy. It's
    proof that you beat
    the Card King![pause][\x0203]But the real battle's
    only just begun!
    Good luck![pause]

    cards to us?[pause][\x0203]I have thought long
    and hard on this, but
    to no avail.[pause]

    cannot allow you to
    pass here yet.[pause][\x0203]If you must, you
    will have to defeat
    me.[pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Bomujii[\x0207]Yes I won at cards,
    but what is the point?[pause][\x0203]This feeling is
    arousing all sorts of
    doubts in me.[pause]
  - "[\\x0207]Tamer Bomujii[\\x0207]Hmm. Perhaps the\nanswer I seek lies \nwithin you.[pause][\\x0203]Very well. \nYou may proceed![pause]"

  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Poemy[\x0207]You insist on passing?
    I, however, cannot
    withdraw from my[pause][\x0203]position. Oh, the
    tragedy! This is truly
    a love story of[pause][\x0203]romantic proportions![pause]
  - |-
    [\x0207]Tamer Poemy[\x0207]What was that?
    Where's this Hero?
    What a let-down![pause][\x0203]Why'd you have to
    ruin the mood like
