  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Masato\x02\x07Oh no! I...
    I lost![pause]\x02\x03This is awful!
    Tomomi's going

  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Alexei\x02\x07When I was turned
    into an Oinkmon, I
    swore to the gods[pause]\x02\x03that if I became
    human again, I'd
    quit drinking![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Alexei\x02\x07Heh heh heh. Alright

    swore I'd never
    drink again![pause]

    tamers![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Tomomi\x02\x07So come help me

    about this to
    Masato![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Tomomi\x02\x07Oh well, I lost. To
    be honest, I don't
    really care about[pause]\x02\x03this competition. I
    just wanted to play
    by myself![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Akiba\x02\x07La la-la la la--la!
    I'm the merry tamer
    Akiba![pause]\x02\x03I've come back to
    Digimon Online.
    La la-la la la--la![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Akiba\x02\x07It would be

    \x02\x07Tamer Akiba\x02\x07Yes I am amazing.

    never quit Digimon
    Online.[pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Akiba\x02\x07This is horrible!
    I... I lost!

    bear to sing
    anymore today![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Gon\x02\x07Aaaah! Just when I
    hid myself, someone

    are hard to stop![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Gon\x02\x07Indeed, that was
    quite
    embarrassing.[pause]\x02\x03How about I
    make it up with
    a card game?[pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Gon\x02\x07Indeed, I won.
    I'm sorry!
    Wait a minute.[pause]\x02\x03You're the one at
    fault for not
    training enough![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Gon\x02\x07Indeed, you are quite
    powerful. I'm feel so
    safe knowing there[pause]\x02\x03are strong tamers like
    you around![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Wan\x02\x07I knew Digimon Online
    would be running

    Kurt brought it back![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Wan\x02\x07So how about a game
    of cards? I won't
    hold back![pause]

    long. How about
    some cards?[pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Kenny\x02\x07Alright!
    I beat \x02\x08\x01\x02\x05\x01![pause]\x02\x03Oh yes! I'm going to
    tell everyone about
    this![pause]
  - |-

    Eeeheheheheh![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Jessica\x02\x07Oh I feel bad
    beating you.
    But you don't nearly[pause]\x02\x03have as much
    experience as I do
    at cards.[pause]
  - |-

    really are good at
    this! I look forward[pause]\x02\x03to seeing how strong
    you'll become!
    Eeeheheheheh![pause]

    \x02\x07Tamer Haruko\x02\x07Hm? Hey, you're
    the one who beat
    A.o.A., right?[pause]\x02\x03Wow! One tamer
    saved the entire
    world![pause]

    granting this old
    lady her dream![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Haruko\x02\x07Oh my! I beat you

    Tamers nowadays[pause]\x02\x03just aren't what
    they used to be.[pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Haruko\x02\x07Oh my, I lost![pause]\x02\x03I guess my days as
    "Gal Gamer Haruko"
    are over.[pause]
  - |-

    cards![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Keith\x02\x07My main man \x02\x08\x01\x02\x05\x01!
    What is up! You've come
    far, but I'm afraid your[pause]\x02\x03luck ends here! Let me
    explain it to you. You

    I'm simply too cool to
    lose, capiche?[pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Keith\x02\x07You got it?
    Alright then,
    let's go![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Keith\x02\x07Hahahaha!
    You see? It's like I
    was saying. I am the[pause]\x02\x03Card King! You just
    don't have what it
    takes to defeat ME![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Keith\x02\x07No! This cannot be
    happening![pause]\x02\x03You are inextricably
    unbelievable! Here,
    take this. It's the [pause]\x02\x03KoC Trophy. It's
    proof that you beat
    the Card King![pause]\x02\x03But the real battle's
    only just begun!
    Good luck![pause]
  - "\\x02\\x07Keith\\x02\\x07You're really \nsomething to beat me!\nBut there are a lot[pause]\\x02\\x03more ruthless\ndesperados out there,\nso watch your back![pause]"

  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Bomujii\x02\x07Tell me, what are
    cards to us?[pause]\x02\x03I have thought long
    and hard on this, but
    to no avail.[pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Bomujii\x02\x07I'm sorry, but I
    cannot allow you to
    pass here yet.[pause]\x02\x03If you must, you
    will have to defeat
    me.[pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Bomujii\x02\x07Yes I won at cards,
    but what is the point?[pause]\x02\x03This feeling is
    arousing all sorts of
    doubts in me.[pause]
  - "\\x02\\x07Tamer Bomujii\\x02\\x07Hmm. Perhaps the\nanswer I seek lies \nwithin you.[pause]\\x02\\x03Very well. \nYou may proceed![pause]"
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Bomujii\x02\x07So, you're off.
    Master the way
    of the cards![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Pierre\x02\x07Bonjour Monsieur. I'm

    oh non non![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Pierre\x02\x07If you absolument
    insist, you must
    defeat moi![pause]\x02\x03One match,
    s'il vous plait![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Pierre\x02\x07Sacre Bleu! I'm so
    terribly sorry.[pause]\x02\x03I'll be here if you
    wish to play again.
    Au revoir![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Pierre\x02\x07Tres Bien! You have
    defeated me soundly![pause]\x02\x03Very well, you may
    pass.[pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Pierre\x02\x07Monsieur's power is
    incroyable![pause]\x02\x03I will also strive
    hard not to lose.[pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Poemy\x02\x07Most venerable
    hero! Danger lies
    beyond here.[pause]\x02\x03Please cease and
    desist your
    progression![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Poemy\x02\x07You insist on passing?
    I, however, cannot
    withdraw from my[pause]\x02\x03position. Oh, the
    tragedy! This is truly
    a love story of[pause]\x02\x03romantic proportions![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Poemy\x02\x07What was that?
    Where's this Hero?
    What a let-down![pause]\x02\x03Why'd you have to
    ruin the mood like
    that? I hate you![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Poemy\x02\x07Oh how brave,
    Hero![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Poemy\x02\x07Oh valiant Hero![pause]\x02\x03I am always thinking
    of you![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Haruka\x02\x07Oh ho ho ho! I
    am an invincible
    female tamer![pause]\x02\x03I will not allow
    you to proceed![pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Haruka\x02\x07You dare challenge
    me? Not knowing
    one's limits can be[pause]\x02\x03called bravery,
    I suppose.[pause]
  - |-
    \x02\x07Tamer Haruka\x02\x07Oh ho ho ho!
    Witness my power!
    Now then, if you've[pause]\x02\x03realized how foolish
    you are, depart
    from here at once![pause]
  - |-
